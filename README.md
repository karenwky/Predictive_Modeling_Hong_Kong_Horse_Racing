# Predictive Modeling: Hong Kong Horse Racing
With supervised machine learning models, predict the winning horse with data of various features. 

## Data Source
Data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gdaley/hkracing) user Graham Daley, containing two sets of data about horse information and race information. 

## Features Explanation
> won - whether horse won (1) or otherwise (0)<br/>
horse_age - current age of this horse at the time of the race<br/>
horse_rating - rating number assigned by HKJC to this horse at the time of the race<br/>
horse_gear - string representing the gear carried by the horse in the race. An explanation of the codes used may be found on the HKJC website.<br/>
declared_weight - declared weight of the horse and jockey, in lbs<br/>
actual_weight - actual weight carried by the horse, in lbs<br/>
draw - post position number of the horse in this race<br/>
win_odds - win odds for this horse at start of race<br/>
place_odds - place (finishing in 1st, 2nd or 3rd position) odds for this horse at start of race<br/>
surface - a number representing the type of race track surface: 1 = dirt, 0 = turf<br/>
distance - distance of the race, in metres<br/>
race_class - a number representing the class of the race<br/>
horse_country - country of origin of this horse<br/>
horse_type - sex of the horse, e.g. 'Gelding', 'Mare', 'Horse', 'Rig', 'Colt', 'Filly'<br/>
venue - a 2-character string, representing which of the 2 race courses this race took place at: ST = Shatin, HV = Happy Valley<br/>
config - race track configuration, mostly related to the position of the inside rail. For more details, see the HKJC website.<br/>
going - track condition. For more details, see the HKJC website.

## Data Preprocessing
![Labels](/images/labels.png)<br/>
As the data is extremely skewed, resampling library [`imblearn`](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is used. Under-sampling method RandomUnderSampler (RUS) and over-sampling method Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) are used for different model experiments. 

## Modeling
<b>1. KNeighborsClassifier (kNN Classifier)</b>
   
   For this dataset, the target is to minimize False Positive, which means `prediction: win, actual: lose`. So the metric is set to be precision score of the positive class (1), which is the win label. Thus, find out the optimized k-value with for loops.

<b>2. LightGBM</b>
   
   Building a fast gradient boosting framework with adjusting the optimized threshold value to obtain the precision score of the positive class (1) as high as possible.

   Top 10 important features are shown, win odds and place odds are particularly ranked highly for all of the models.

* By processing a lot of data, kNN model trained with over-sampled data took the longest time, while LightGBM model trained with under-sampled data took the shortest time. 
* kNN models performed relatively worse with low precision score and f1-score of the positive class (1). 
* Training models aimed at minimize False Positive (predict: win, actual: lose), but it seems True Positive and False Positive are correlated. Same as gambling and investment, you have the chance to win and the risk to lose at the same time.
* File sizes of LightGBM models are incredibly small and the time spent on training models is really quick. 

## Predictions
With data for one of the races in the dataset (which is excluded in training the models), predict the winning horse. 

<b>1. KNeighborsClassifier (kNN Classifier)</b>

   For kNN models, only model trained with under-sampled data can predict the winning horse. However, there is one False Positive in the prediction.

   With setting the threshold value same as the models trained, all LightGBM models achieved 100% accuracy.

## Things to be Improved
* Correlation between features is ignored. 
* Feature scaling was not performed for different range of numeric values. 
* One-hot encoding was not performed and just keeping the numeric values for some categorical features such as `draw` and `race_class`. 
* Finetuning of hyperparameters for kNN classifier models is ignored. GridSearchCV can be performed to experiment better results. 
* The volume of test data is small, so the highly-accurate prediction result is more of luckiness. More data can be used to do the testing experiment.

## Skills Acquired
* Pandas: e.g. data cleaning and data imputation, one-hot encoding for categorical features
* Scikit-learn: e.g. fine-tuning hyperparameters of the training models, setting metrics in evaluating models
* Joblib: saving and loading trained machine learning models
